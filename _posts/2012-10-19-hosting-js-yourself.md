categories: [apis, javascript]
summary: We recommend you do not host the JavaScript yourself, but here are the considerations if you decide to.

If you decide to host the JavaScript Library yourself for the purpose of optimization, here are the features that are lost:

* You would not receive code updates to the JavaScript Library, if we add functionality, optimize, or fix bugs.
* The Event Library/Event Wizard will not work, since it will update only your hosted JavaScript file.

We may consider having a notification system, but it is not planned yet.
